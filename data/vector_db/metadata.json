Responding to the findings by DoT, Bharti Airtel official told HT that it has deployed AI-based, network-level tools to curb spam and fraud, claiming to have blocked over 70 billion suspected spam calls in the past two years. Citing analysis by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre under the Ministry of Home Affairs, the company official said financial losses on its network fell 68% and overall cybercrime incidents declined 14%. The official added that it introduced a network-based AI spam detection solution in September 2024 that alerts users in real time about suspected spam calls and messages, and later expanded the system in May 2025 to detect and block malicious links across platforms such as messaging apps, email, and other online services.",
